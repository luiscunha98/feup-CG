## Project

### How to play the game

In this game your objective is to collect the wood, put it on the train and move on to the next station. In order to do that you need to know the controllers for this game which are the following:
- `w` Move Crane Arm Up
- `a` Move Crane Arm Left
- `s` Move Crane Arm Down
- `d` Move Crane Arm Right
- `p` Pick/Drop Wood either from the station or the train
- `c` Start Moving the train automatically to the next station

### Extra Info

- In order for the train to move it has to move the wood from the station to the train, you can think of the wood as fuel for the train since the moment you arrive to the next station the wood is used so you need to refill it.
